## 5. Comparison to other AI models that generate images:

In this section, we will compare Distillery with other AI models, namely Midjourney, Bing AI, and a random AI image-generating website - DeepAI.

- **DeepAI**: Lacks the capability to produce realistic, life-like pictures, but compensates with being free and offering an unlimited number of image generations.

- **Bing AI**: Developed by Microsoft, based on the Dall-E 3 model created by OpenAI. Demonstrates high accuracy, generating up to 30 images per conversation. Similar to DeepAI, Bing AI is free and only requires the Edge web browser and a Microsoft Store account.

- **Midjourney**: Stands out as the most accurate AI image generation model but comes at a higher cost. Even the cheapest plan is priced at over $12 per month (including taxes), making Distillery's "normal" plan more cost-effective. Midjourney also imposes limitations on the number of image generations per month.

A comparison of the photos generated by selected models can be found in the "Comparison" directory located in `Distillery--Assignment-from-AI-tools/Comparison`. The photos are named according to the AI model that generated them, using the same prompt.
