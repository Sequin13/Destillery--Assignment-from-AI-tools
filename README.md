# Distillery--Assignment-from-AI-tools
Distillery is an semi-free AI tool, that allows to create an images, using prompts.
  1. Why this tool?
     Distillry is generating quite realistic pictures. The AI algorithm listens to what we want to achieve and it is serving us an amazing four pictures of that, what we wrote in       the prompt.
  2. What use did you find?
     My idea for for using this tool is creating prints on clothes. Images can be printed on clothing through the Amazon Merch on Demand service, allowing for the creation of           customized merch that can be offered for sale on the Amazon platform.
