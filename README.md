# Distillery--Assignment-from-AI-tools
In the realm of artificial intelligence, Distillery emerges as a captivating tool that empowers individuals to transform their imagination into stunning visual masterpieces. This semi-free platform seamlessly blends simplicity with sophistication, allowing users to conjure up captivating images using mere words as prompts.
  1. Why this tool?
     Distillry is generating quite realistic pictures. The AI algorithm listens to what we want to achieve and it is serving us an amazing four pictures of that, what we wrote in the prompt.
  2. What use did you find?
     My idea for for using this tool is creating prints on clothes. Images can be printed on clothing through the Amazon Merch on Demand service, allowing for the creation of           customized merch that can be offered for sale on the Amazon platform.
  3. Presentation of the use:
     In the directory, located in Destillery--Assignment-from-AI-tools/PrintsIdeasDistillery there are a images of potential prints, that could be applied on merch.
  4. Advantages and disadvantages of Distillery:
     a) Advantages:
       - Generating up to 10 images per day for free
       - Quite accurate with the prompt
       - Unlimited number of generated pictures in paid version
       - Helpful community and administration
     b) Disadvantages:
       - In free version, there is a huge diffrence in quality, compared to paid version
       - Quite high price, for paid version
       - Often doesn't understands simmple prompts and requires more context in prompt
  5. Comparison to other AI models, that also generates images:
    In this section, we will compare Distillery with other AI models, namely Midjourney, Bing AI, and a random AI image-generating website - DeepAI.
    Firstly, DeepAI lacks the capability to produce realistic, life-like pictures. However, it compensates with being free and offering an unlimited number of image generations.
    Bing AI, developed by Microsoft, is based on the Dall-E 3 model created by OpenAI. It demonstrates high accuracy and can generate up to 30 images per conversation. Similar to DeepAI, Bing AI is free and only requires the Edge web browser and a Microsoft Store account.
    Midjourney stands out as the most accurate AI image generation model, albeit with a higher cost. The cheapest plan is priced at over $12 per month (including taxes), and the most expensive plan is $120 per month (excluding taxes). When comparing the pricing of Midjourney and Distillery (paid version), Distillery proves to be more cost-effective. The price of the Basic plan for Midjourney is equivalent to the cost of Distillery's "normal" plan. Additionally, Midjourney, even on its most expensive plan, imposes limitations on the number of image generations per month.
     A comparison of the photos generated by selected models can be found in the "Comparison" directory located in Destillery--Assignment-from-AI-tools/Comparison. The photos are named according to the AI model that generated them, using same prompt.
