# Distillery - Assignment from AI Tools

In the realm of artificial intelligence, Distillery emerges as a captivating tool that empowers individuals to transform their imagination into stunning visual masterpieces. This semi-free platform seamlessly blends simplicity with sophistication, allowing users to conjure up captivating images using mere words as prompts.

## 1. Why this tool?

Distillery is capable of generating remarkably realistic pictures. The AI algorithm listens to our intentions and serves us with four amazing images based on the provided prompt.

## 2. How I use it?

My idea of using this tool is to create prints on clothing, leveraging the convenience and efficiency of the Amazon Merch on Demand service. With this platform, I can effortlessly translate my creative visions into reality by printing images on various clothing items. This not only allows me to explore my artistic expressions but also empowers me to craft personalized and unique merchandise.

In addition, I would like to mention that all the pictures showcase Maine Coon cats because these cats serve as my inspiration in the context of tourism (they love to travel), and I personally adore this breed. My envisioned "clothing brand" would be named MaineCool.

## 3. Presentation of the use

In the directory, located at `Distillery--Assignment-from-AI-tools/PrintsIdeasDistillery`, you can find images of potential prints that could be applied to merchandise.

## 4. Advantages and disadvantages of Distillery:

### a) Advantages:

- Generates up to 10 images per day for free.
- Demonstrates accuracy with the prompt.
- Unlimited image generation in the paid version.
- Supportive community and administration.

### b) Disadvantages:

- Noticeable difference in quality between free and paid versions.
- Relatively high price for the paid version.
- Sometimes struggles with simple prompts and requires additional context.

## 5. Comparison to other AI models that generate images:

In this section, we will compare Distillery with other AI models, namely Midjourney, Bing AI, and a random AI image-generating website - DeepAI.

- **DeepAI**: Lacks the capability to produce realistic, life-like pictures, but compensates with being free and offering an unlimited number of image generations.

- **Bing AI**: Developed by Microsoft, based on the Dall-E 3 model created by OpenAI. Demonstrates high accuracy, generating up to 30 images per conversation. Similar to DeepAI, Bing AI is free and only requires the Edge web browser and a Microsoft Store account.

- **Midjourney**: Stands out as the most accurate AI image generation model but comes at a higher cost. Even the cheapest plan is priced at over $12 per month (including taxes), making Distillery's "normal" plan more cost-effective. Midjourney also imposes limitations on the number of image generations per month.

A comparison of the photos generated by selected models can be found in the "Comparison" directory located in `Distillery--Assignment-from-AI-tools/Comparison`. The photos are named according to the AI model that generated them, using the same prompt.
